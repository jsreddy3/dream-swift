**What they share:**
"Sarah shared a dream with you! 🌙✨ Check it out: https://dreamapp.com/shared/abc123"

**Implementation:**
- Backend API to create shareable links
- Web frontend with responsive design
- Database for shared content
- 1-2 weeks development time

---

## Option C: Hybrid Approach

### What the recipient sees:
1. **Beautiful image** (like Option A) appears immediately
2. **Plus accompanying text**: "See the full dream and interpretation: https://dreamapp.com/shared/abc123"
3. **Web page** (like Option B) for full experience

**Implementation:**
- Combine both approaches
- Most work but best experience
- 2-3 weeks development time

---

## My Recommendation: Start with Option A

**Why Generated Image is best for MVP:**

✅ **Elegant & Simple**
- Pure client-side implementation
- No infrastructure costs
- Ships in 1-2 days

✅ **Beautiful User Experience**
- Immediate visual impact
- Works in all messaging apps
- Maintains app's visual brand

✅ **Effective Conversion**
- QR code for instant download
- App branding creates awareness
- Low friction sharing experience

✅ **Privacy Friendly**
- No backend storage of dreams
- User controls what gets shared
- Content lives only in the image

**Later Enhancement Path:**
- Start with images (quick win)
- Add web landing pages later if needed
- Measure sharing metrics to guide decisions
